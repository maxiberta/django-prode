Django PRODE
============
django-prode is a multiplayer sports forecast (aka. PRODE in Argentina) game for Django.
* Matches can be loaded from iCal (or manually), and associated with a tournament.
* The frontend page shows the user score table in real time.

Rules
-----
* Players (users) are allowed to submit one forecast per not-yet-played match.
* Players gain points by guessing the score perfectly (2 points) or the overall result (team1 wins, team2 wins or tie - 1 point).
* On the end of the tournament the player with the most points is the winner.

Setup
-----
* Add django_prode into your settings.INSTALLED_APPS (and uncomment the admin app if necessary)
* Download a tournament calendar in iCal format and import it with the "loadical" admin command::
    
    # ./manage.py loadical <ical file> [-t <tournament name>]

* Create staff users with at least add and change forecast permissions
* Add the score table into your URLconf::

    url(r'^$', include('django_prode.urls')),

Requirements
------------
- Django 1.3
- django-tables
- python-icalendar

TODO
----
* Rules are hardcoded in fixture.models.Forecast.score(); they should be customizable
* Dates and times (clients, server and matches) are presumed to be in UTC; time zones should be taken into account
